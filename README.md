# T cell receptor repertoire signatures associated with COVID-19 severity

Code and analysis for the manuscript "T cell receptor repertoire signatures associated with COVID-19 severity"

The code is organized into the following folders:
  
+ `notebooks`: which contains the actual experiments. They should be ran top to bottom.
In certain cases, they include quite computationally expensive, and some pre-processed files are
  already included in the `data/` folder so that these can be skipped.
  
+ `scripts`: which contain data cleaning scripts and supplemental experiments.
